# Solutions for Queen's domination
Contains solutions for the problem of determining a (independent) minimum dominating set of the Queen's Graph $Q_n$. Every vertex $v \in V(Q_n)$ of the graph corresponds to a square of the $n x n$ chessboard and two squares are adjacent, if and only if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.
